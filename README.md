# Assistance for Disabled People in French SNCF Stations

## Project Description
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the assistance services offered to people with reduced mobility across the French National Railway Company (SNCF) network. Through exploratory data analysis and advanced analytics in Python, followed by interactive visualization in Tableau, we seek to uncover regional disparities, analyze the correlation between station traffic and assistance provided, and offer recommendations to improve service accessibility. The ultimate goal is to enhance the travel experience for disabled individuals within the SNCF network.

## Data Source(s)
The dataset for this analysis is sourced from two primary locations:
- **SNCF Open Data**: [ressources.data.sncf.com](https://ressources.data.sncf.com)
- **French Government Open Data Portal**: [data.gouv.fr](https://data.gouv.fr)

This data includes detailed records of assistance provided to people with reduced mobility in over 871 SNCF stations from 2015 to 2022, covering types of assistance provided, station information, and geographical data.

## Research Questions
Our analysis focuses on several key questions to guide improvements in SNCF's service offering:
1. Are there regional disparities in the assistance services provided within the SNCF network?
2. What is the relationship between a station's passenger volume and the frequency of assistance provided?
3. How does the availability of wheelchairs in stations impact the type and number of assistance services offered?
4. Does the station's location (urban vs. rural) influence the level of service provided to people with reduced mobility?
5. Based on our findings, what actionable recommendations can we make to improve the accessibility and quality of service across the SNCF network?

## Cleaning Procedures
The data underwent rigorous cleaning processes, including:
- Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
- Standardizing the format of categorical variables and converting data types for numerical analysis.
- Ensuring geographic data accuracy for subsequent geospatial analysis.
- Aggregating data where necessary to facilitate more efficient analysis.
- Creating a consistent naming convention for ease of interpretation and analysis.

## Tableau Dashboard
The results of our analysis have been synthesized into an interactive dashboard hosted on Tableau Public, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring our findings and recommendations. The dashboard includes geospatial visualizations, trend analyses, and comparative metrics across different regions and station categories.
